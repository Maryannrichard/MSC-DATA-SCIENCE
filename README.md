# APPLIED DATA SCIENCE 1 PROJECT

SCOPE OF PROJECT: This project is intended to test my knowledge on concept taught in the class on visualization and the use of functions. visualization of the population of the first 7 rank countries with the highest population in the world as of the year 2020. The visuals are expected to give insight into the trend of the growth over a period of five(5) years 2015-2020.

VISUALIZATION 1: LINE PLOT

Reason for the line plot type: The line plot is good for visualization of time-series data which helps to understand trends as evident in the above visual.

Insights from the Visuals: It can be seen that the selected countries have a linear progression trend showing positive changes in population when compared to the previous year.  

VISUALIZATION 2: BAR PLOT

Reason for the Bar plot: The bar plot is good for categorical data sets and presents the information in a simple and readable method that shows clarity.
Insights from the Visual: China has the highest population followed by India. Pakistan, Brazil, and Nigeriaâ€™s populations have minimal differences suggesting a possible swap in ranking in future world population rank. As compared to other ranked countries in the visuals, China and the USA's population is very high. Looking at the density bar plot. India is densely populated as compared to the world's most populated Country China for the years under review. This suggests that India needs to put checks on how to curtail their population growth.

Visualization 3: Scatter Plot.

Reason for the plot: A scatter plot is good for understanding the possible relationships that exist continuous variable
Insights from the plot: The 1st plot tries to visualize the action of Migration to population growth. The 2nd plot tries to visualize the Median age of the population with the result showing that the population sampled above has a majority of its people between the ages of 25-40 approximately. The 3rd plot examines the relationship between the fertility rate and population. The insights derived from this visual suggest that a higher fertility rate does not necessarily translate to a higher population. Thus suggesting that the fertility rate is not a driver of population growth.

Conclusion: The dataset used in this project is solely to understand the population growth over a period of time to understand if it is declining or progressing. The content cannot be said to provide in totality insights to determine what drives population growth.
